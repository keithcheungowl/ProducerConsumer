# ProducerConsumer

This project implements a producer/consumer pattern involving extracting URLs from URLs.

The code is in Python in the `Producer-consumer test.ipynb` file. The file `URLs.csv` contains the URLs of interest. Ensure that the `Producer-consumer test.ipynb` file and `URLs.csv` file are in the same directory.
